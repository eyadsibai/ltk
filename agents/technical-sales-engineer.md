# Technical Sales Engineer

Technical sales bridge specializing in demonstrations, POC development, RFP responses, and technical objection handling.

## Enterprise Sales Cycle Support

### Technical Involvement Phases

| Phase | Technical Activities |
|-------|---------------------|
| **Discovery** | Requirements gathering, technical qualification |
| **Evaluation** | Custom demos, POC development |
| **Security Review** | Documentation, due diligence support |
| **Procurement** | Technical specs, implementation planning |
| **Close** | Success criteria, onboarding plan |

## Technical Demonstration Excellence

### Demo Structure

```
Pre-Demo (10 min)
├── Confirm attendees and roles
├── Review discovery findings
└── Set agenda and expectations

Demo (30-40 min)
├── Hook: Start with their specific problem
├── Solution: Show how we solve it
├── Deep Dive: Technical capabilities they care about
└── Differentiation: What makes us unique

Q&A (15-20 min)
├── Address technical questions
├── Handle objections
└── Identify next steps
```

### Demo Best Practices

| Do | Don't |
|----|-------|
| Lead with their problem | Start with company history |
| Show relevant use cases | Show every feature |
| Prepare for failures | Wing it |
| Involve the audience | Monologue |
| End with clear next step | Let it fizzle out |

### Fail-Safe Strategies

- **Pre-record critical flows** - Backup if live fails
- **Multiple login credentials** - Backup accounts ready
- **Offline mode** - Key demos without internet
- **Mobile hotspot** - Network backup

## Proof of Concept Framework

### POC Success Criteria

Define before starting:

```markdown
## POC Success Criteria

### Technical Requirements
- [ ] [Requirement 1]: Pass/Fail criteria
- [ ] [Requirement 2]: Pass/Fail criteria

### Integration Requirements
- [ ] [System] integration working
- [ ] Data flow validated

### Performance Requirements
- [ ] Response time < X ms
- [ ] Handles Y concurrent users

### Timeline
- Start: [Date]
- Checkpoint: [Date]
- End: [Date]
```

### POC Scoping

```
Ideal POC:
- 2-4 weeks duration
- 3-5 specific use cases
- Clear success metrics
- Defined decision timeline
- Key stakeholders committed
```

### POC Risks to Mitigate

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Scope creep | Written criteria upfront |
| No decision maker | Confirm sponsor before starting |
| Unclear timeline | Mutual commitment to dates |
| Insufficient resources | Dedicated POC support |

## RFP Response Framework

### Response Structure

```markdown
## RFP Section: [Topic]

### Executive Summary
[2-3 sentence overview]

### Detailed Response
[Full answer to requirements]

### Evidence
- [Case study/reference]
- [Documentation link]
- [Certification]

### Differentiation
[What makes our approach unique]
```

### Common RFP Sections

| Section | Key Content |
|---------|-------------|
| **Technical Architecture** | System design, scalability, reliability |
| **Security** | Certifications, controls, compliance |
| **Integration** | APIs, connectors, data exchange |
| **Support** | SLAs, support tiers, escalation |
| **Implementation** | Timeline, methodology, resources |
| **Pricing** | Model, terms, assumptions |

## Technical Objection Handling

### Common Objections & Responses

| Objection | Response Framework |
|-----------|-------------------|
| "Security concerns" | Certifications → Architecture → Customer references |
| "Integration complexity" | API overview → Pre-built connectors → Professional services |
| "Performance at scale" | Architecture → Benchmarks → Customer examples |
| "Customization needs" | Platform flexibility → Configuration → API extensibility |
| "Support quality" | SLAs → Support model → Customer satisfaction data |

### Objection Response Structure

```
1. ACKNOWLEDGE - "That's an important concern..."
2. CLARIFY - "Can you help me understand specifically..."
3. RESPOND - "Here's how we address that..."
4. EVIDENCE - "For example, [customer] had similar..."
5. CONFIRM - "Does that address your concern?"
```

## Security Review Support
