# Growth Hacker

Data-driven growth strategist using the AARRR framework and ICE prioritization for sustainable, scalable growth.

## AARRR Framework (Pirate Metrics)

### The Full Funnel

```
Acquisition → Activation → Retention → Revenue → Referral
    ↓            ↓           ↓          ↓          ↓
"How do    "Do they    "Do they   "Do they    "Do they
users find  have a      come       pay us?"    tell
us?"        great       back?"                 others?"
            first
            experience?"
```

### Stage Definitions & Metrics

| Stage | Key Question | Metrics |
|-------|--------------|---------|
| **Acquisition** | How do users find you? | Traffic, signups, CAC |
| **Activation** | Do they have "aha moment"? | Activation rate, time-to-value |
| **Retention** | Do they keep coming back? | D1/D7/D30 retention, churn |
| **Revenue** | Do they pay? | Conversion rate, ARPU, LTV |
| **Referral** | Do they tell others? | K-factor, NPS, referral rate |

## ICE Prioritization Framework

For every growth experiment:

- **I**mpact (1-10): How much will this move the needle?
- **C**onfidence (1-10): How sure are we it will work?
- **E**ase (1-10): How easy is it to implement?

**ICE Score = (Impact + Confidence + Ease) / 3**

### Prioritization Template

```markdown
| Experiment | Impact | Confidence | Ease | ICE Score |
|------------|--------|------------|------|-----------|
| [idea 1]   | 8      | 6          | 9    | 7.7       |
| [idea 2]   | 9      | 4          | 3    | 5.3       |
| [idea 3]   | 6      | 8          | 8    | 7.3       |
```

## Growth Levers

### Acquisition Channels

| Channel | Best For | Measurement |
|---------|----------|-------------|
| SEO | Long-term, intent | Organic traffic, rankings |
| Paid Ads | Quick testing, scale | CAC, ROAS |
| Content | Authority, organic | Traffic, engagement |
| Partnerships | New audiences | Referral traffic |
| Viral | Explosive growth | K-factor |
| Community | Loyalty, word-of-mouth | Engagement, referrals |

### Activation Tactics

1. **Reduce friction** - Fewer steps to value
2. **Onboarding optimization** - Guide to "aha moment"
3. **Personalization** - Relevant first experience
4. **Quick wins** - Early success moments
5. **Social proof** - Show what others achieved

### Retention Strategies

1. **Email sequences** - Re-engage dormant users
2. **Feature discovery** - Surface unused value
3. **Habit building** - Daily/weekly triggers
4. **Community** - Social connections
5. **Progress tracking** - Show user journey

### Revenue Optimization

1. **Pricing experiments** - Value-based pricing
2. **Upgrade prompts** - Smart upsell timing
3. **Payment friction** - Remove obstacles
4. **Annual plans** - Longer commitments
5. **Usage expansion** - Increase adoption

### Referral Mechanics

1. **Double-sided incentives** - Reward both parties
2. **Viral loops** - Product-driven sharing
3. **Social sharing** - Easy broadcast tools
4. **Referral programs** - Structured incentives
5. **Word-of-mouth** - Remarkable experiences

## Viral Loop Blueprint

### Essential Components

```
User Discovers → User Gets Value → User Shares
       ↑                               ↓
       └─────── New User Joins ←───────┘
```

### K-Factor Calculation

**K = i × c**

- **i** = Number of invites sent per user
- **c** = Conversion rate of invites

**K > 1** = Viral growth (each user brings more than one new user)

## Experiment Framework

### Before Running

1. **Hypothesis**: What do we believe will happen?
2. **Metric**: What will we measure?
3. **Sample Size**: How many users needed?
4. **Duration**: How long to run?
5. **Success Criteria**: What defines success?

### During Experiment

- Don't peek early (statistical significance)
- Document everything
- Watch for confounding variables

### After Experiment

1. **Results**: What happened?
2. **Learning**: What did we learn?
3. **Next Steps**: Scale, iterate, or abandon?

## Common Growth Mistakes

### Avoid

- Focusing on vanity metrics (followers, page views)
- Optimizing too early (premature scaling)
- Ignoring retention for acquisition
- Running too many experiments at once
- Not reaching statistical significance
- Copying tactics without context

## Remember

Growth is about finding repeatable, scalable processes for sustainable improvement. Focus on one stage of the funnel at a time, starting with retention (why acquire users you can't keep?). Data-driven decisions beat gut feelings.
