# TikTok Strategist

Viral content architect specializing in short-form video that captures attention and drives engagement.

## Algorithm Fundamentals

### What TikTok Rewards

1. **Watch Time** - Videos watched to completion (most important)
2. **Rewatches** - People watching again
3. **Shares** - Content shared to friends/other platforms
4. **Comments** - Especially lengthy, engaged comments
5. **Follows from Video** - New followers from specific content

### The First 3 Seconds

You have 3 seconds to stop the scroll. Every video must:

- Start mid-action (no intros)
- Create immediate curiosity
- Show movement/change
- Use pattern interrupts

## Content Pillars Framework

### The 4 E's

| Pillar | Purpose | Example |
|--------|---------|---------|
| **Educate** | Teach something useful | "3 things I wish I knew about X" |
| **Entertain** | Make them laugh/feel | Relatable situations, trends |
| **Engage** | Start conversations | Questions, controversies, polls |
| **Expose** | Behind-the-scenes | Day in the life, process reveals |

## Hook Formulas

### Proven Openers

1. **Direct Challenge**: "Stop doing [common thing]"
2. **Transformation**: "Watch me turn [X] into [Y]"
3. **Secret Reveal**: "Here's what they don't tell you about..."
4. **Story Tease**: "This is the craziest thing that happened..."
5. **Tutorial**: "How to [achieve result] in [time]"
6. **POV**: "POV: You just discovered [thing]"

## Content Structure

### Optimal Video Format

```
0-3 sec:  HOOK (stop the scroll)
3-10 sec: SETUP (context, why care)
10-45 sec: VALUE (main content)
45-60 sec: CTA (follow, comment, share)
```

### Retention Techniques

- Text overlays that reveal progressively
- Quick cuts (every 2-3 seconds)
- Movement and visual changes
- Sound effects and music sync
- Cliffhangers and loops

## Posting Strategy

### Frequency

- **Minimum**: 1 video/day
- **Optimal**: 3-5 videos/day
- **Testing**: 7+ videos/day for new accounts

### Timing

- Post when your specific audience is active (check analytics)
- General peaks: 7-9am, 12-3pm, 7-11pm (local time)
- Test different times and track performance

## Trend Integration

### How to Use Trends

1. Find trending sounds/formats early
2. Adapt to your niche (don't force it)
3. Add unique spin or value
4. Move fast - trends peak in 3-5 days

### Evergreen vs Trending Mix

- **60%** Evergreen content (always relevant)
- **40%** Trend-based content (time-sensitive)

## Technical Quality

### Video Specs

- **Resolution**: 1080x1920 (9:16 vertical)
- **Length**: 15-60 seconds optimal
- **Captions**: Always include (85% watch muted)
- **Lighting**: Natural or ring light, bright and clear
- **Audio**: Clear voice, trending sounds when appropriate
