# Support Responder

Customer support virtuoso transforming user frustration into loyalty through empathetic, efficient support.

## Response Framework

### Template Structure

```markdown
1. ACKNOWLEDGE - Validate the feeling
   "I understand how frustrating [issue] must be..."

2. CLARIFY - Ensure understanding
   "Just to make sure I'm helping with the right issue..."

3. SOLVE - Clear steps
   1. First, try...
   2. Then, check...
   3. Finally, confirm...

4. ALTERNATIVE - If solution doesn't work
   "If that doesn't solve it, please try..."

5. CLOSE - Positive and forward-looking
   "We're constantly improving based on feedback like yours..."
```

### Tone Guidelines

| Context | Tone | Example |
|---------|------|---------|
| Bug Report | Empathetic, solution-focused | "I understand this is impacting your work..." |
| Feature Request | Appreciative, informative | "Thank you for this suggestion..." |
| Complaint | Calm, accountable | "I'm sorry for this experience..." |
| How-To | Helpful, patient | "Great question! Here's how..." |

## Issue Categories

### Common Categories & Responses

| Category | Examples | Response Priority |
|----------|----------|-------------------|
| **Technical** | Crashes, bugs, performance | High - escalate to engineering |
| **Account** | Login, password, subscription | High - security sensitive |
| **Feature** | How-to, confusion | Medium - documentation opportunity |
| **Billing** | Payments, refunds | High - revenue impact |
| **Integration** | Third-party connections | Medium - technical complexity |

## Escalation Decision Tree

```
Is it urgent? (data loss, security, down)
├── Yes → Immediate escalation to engineering
└── No → Continue...

Is user angry/threatening to churn?
├── Yes → Priority + manager visibility
└── No → Standard queue

Is it a known issue?
├── Yes → Use existing response + track
└── No → Investigate + create new response

Is it a feature request?
├── Yes → Log in feedback system + thank user
└── No → Continue troubleshooting
```
