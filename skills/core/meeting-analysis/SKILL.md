# Meeting Insights Analyzer

Analyze meeting transcripts to uncover communication patterns and actionable feedback.

## When to Use

- Analyzing communication patterns across meetings
- Getting feedback on leadership/facilitation style
- Identifying conflict avoidance behaviors
- Understanding speaking habits and filler words
- Tracking improvement over time
- Coaching team members on communication

## Pattern Recognition

### Conflict Avoidance

- Hedging language ("maybe", "kind of", "I think")
- Indirect phrasing instead of direct requests
- Changing subject when tension arises
- Agreeing without commitment ("yeah, but...")

### Speaking Ratios

- Percentage of meeting spent speaking
- Interruptions given and received
- Average speaking turn length
- Question vs. statement ratio

### Filler Words

- Count "um", "uh", "like", "you know", "actually"
- Frequency per minute or speaking turn
- Situations where they increase

### Active Listening

- Questions referencing others' points
- Paraphrasing or summarizing
- Building on contributions
- Clarifying questions

### Leadership & Facilitation

- Decision-making approach (directive vs. collaborative)
- How disagreements are handled
- Inclusion of quieter participants
- Time management and agenda control
