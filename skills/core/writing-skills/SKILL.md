# Writing Skills

## Overview

**Writing skills IS Test-Driven Development applied to process documentation.**

You write test cases (pressure scenarios with subagents), watch them fail (baseline behavior), write the skill (documentation), watch tests pass (agents comply), and refactor (close loopholes).

**Core principle:** If you didn't watch an agent fail without the skill, you don't know if the skill teaches the right thing.

**REQUIRED BACKGROUND:** You MUST understand ltk:test-driven-development before using this skill. That skill defines the fundamental RED-GREEN-REFACTOR cycle. This skill adapts TDD to documentation.

## What is a Skill?

A **skill** is a reference guide for proven techniques, patterns, or tools. Skills help future Claude instances find and apply effective approaches.

**Skills are:** Reusable techniques, patterns, tools, reference guides

**Skills are NOT:** Narratives about how you solved a problem once

## TDD Mapping for Skills

| TDD Concept | Skill Creation |
|-------------|----------------|
| **Test case** | Pressure scenario with subagent |
| **Production code** | Skill document (SKILL.md) |
| **Test fails (RED)** | Agent violates rule without skill (baseline) |
| **Test passes (GREEN)** | Agent complies with skill present |
| **Refactor** | Close loopholes while maintaining compliance |

## Skill Types

### Technique

Concrete method with steps to follow (condition-based-waiting, root-cause-tracing)

### Pattern

Way of thinking about problems (flatten-with-flags, test-invariants)

### Reference

API docs, syntax guides, tool documentation

## Directory Structure

```
skills/
  category/
    skill-name/
      SKILL.md              # Main reference (required)
      supporting-file.*     # Only if needed
```

**Separate files for:**

1. **Heavy reference** (100+ lines) - API docs, comprehensive syntax
2. **Reusable tools** - Scripts, utilities, templates

**Keep inline:**

- Principles and concepts
- Code patterns (< 50 lines)
- Everything else

## SKILL.md Structure

**Frontmatter (YAML):**

- Only two fields supported: `name` and `description`
- Max 1024 characters total
- `name`: Use letters, numbers, and hyphens only
- `description`: Third-person, describes ONLY when to use (NOT what it does)
  - Start with "Use when..." to focus on triggering conditions
  - Include specific symptoms, situations, and contexts
  - **NEVER summarize the skill's process or workflow**

```markdown
---
name: Skill-Name-With-Hyphens
description: Use when [specific triggering conditions and symptoms]
---

# Skill Name

## Overview
What is this? Core principle in 1-2 sentences.

## When to Use
Bullet list with SYMPTOMS and use cases
When NOT to use

## Core Pattern (for techniques/patterns)
Before/after code comparison

## Quick Reference
Table or bullets for scanning common operations

## Implementation
Inline code for simple patterns
Link to file for heavy reference or reusable tools

## Common Mistakes
What goes wrong + fixes
```

## Claude Search Optimization (CSO)

**Critical for discovery:** Future Claude needs to FIND your skill

### Rich Description Field

**CRITICAL: Description = When to Use, NOT What the Skill Does**

The description should ONLY describe triggering conditions. Do NOT summarize the skill's process or workflow.

**Why this matters:** When a description summarizes workflow, Claude may follow the description instead of reading the full skill content.

```yaml
# BAD: Summarizes workflow - Claude may follow this instead of reading skill
description: Use when executing plans - dispatches subagent per task with code review between tasks

# GOOD: Just triggering conditions, no workflow summary
description: Use when executing implementation plans with independent tasks in the current session
```

### Keyword Coverage

Use words Claude would search for:

- Error messages: "Hook timed out", "race condition"
- Symptoms: "flaky", "hanging", "zombie"
- Synonyms: "timeout/hang/freeze"
- Tools: Actual commands, library names

### Descriptive Naming

**Use active voice, verb-first:**

- `creating-skills` not `skill-creation`
- `condition-based-waiting` not `async-test-helpers`

## The Iron Law (Same as TDD)

```
NO SKILL WITHOUT A FAILING TEST FIRST
```

This applies to NEW skills AND EDITS to existing skills.

Write skill before testing? Delete it. Start over.

## RED-GREEN-REFACTOR for Skills

### RED: Write Failing Test (Baseline)

Run pressure scenario with subagent WITHOUT the skill. Document exact behavior:

- What choices did they make?
- What rationalizations did they use (verbatim)?
- Which pressures triggered violations?

### GREEN: Write Minimal Skill

Write skill that addresses those specific rationalizations. Don't add extra content for hypothetical cases.

Run same scenarios WITH skill. Agent should now comply.

### REFACTOR: Close Loopholes

Agent found new rationalization? Add explicit counter. Re-test until bulletproof.

## Skill Creation Checklist

**RED Phase - Write Failing Test:**

- [ ] Create pressure scenarios
- [ ] Run scenarios WITHOUT skill - document baseline behavior verbatim
- [ ] Identify patterns in rationalizations/failures

**GREEN Phase - Write Minimal Skill:**

- [ ] Name uses only letters, numbers, hyphens
- [ ] YAML frontmatter with only name and description (max 1024 chars)
- [ ] Description starts with "Use when..." and includes specific triggers/symptoms
- [ ] Description written in third person
- [ ] Keywords throughout for search
- [ ] Clear overview with core principle
- [ ] Address specific baseline failures identified in RED
- [ ] Run scenarios WITH skill - verify agents now comply

**REFACTOR Phase - Close Loopholes:**

- [ ] Identify NEW rationalizations from testing
- [ ] Add explicit counters
- [ ] Build rationalization table from all test iterations
- [ ] Re-test until bulletproof

**Deployment:**

- [ ] Commit skill to git
